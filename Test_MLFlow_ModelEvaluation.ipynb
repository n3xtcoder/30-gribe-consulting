Another point, it handles more complex data formats in the messages between the user and system: they can include text, images, and other files.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat-completions). These don't count on persistent conversation's history; instead, the messages that want to be kept in the ongoing conversation have to be manually added as part of the \"context\". Also Chat Completions support text and image, but only as an input, and can output text content (e.g., code and JSON).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:** Check the most suitable also taking into account pricing and token usage. Make tests with real users to understand how long the chat sessions tend to be and whether it is really convenient to store a history (e.g., new questions on the same session related to a very early message). Perhaps if questions are more direct and instructive on specific pieces of content, including just a few messages as context is enough - so Chat Completions should be fine."
